# Welcome to Payback.

Payback is a free app to help you track expenses among members of a group. The interface is designed with simplicity in mind, and looks great on your phone for when you're on the go.

## How does it work?
__Sign Up__  
Getting started with Payback is simple. Once you've signed up for an account, you can create groups to track your expenses. With a simple ID and password, your friends can join your group with a button press.

__Start Spending__  
Adding expenses is as easy as it gets. You can select whether you want to divide the amount among all members of a group, or just a few. You're given two options when creating a new expense - Split Evenly or Payback, which determines how the cost will be split. That's all there is to it! Payback will take care of all the math for you, and never forgets.

## Can I sign up?
Payback is still undergoing active development and isn't quite ready yet. In the meantime, all of the code is open source so that you can poke around and contribute if you'd like!
